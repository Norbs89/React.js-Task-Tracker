# Task Tracker

A purpose built mini-app to practice React.js. The project was developed using a fake (local) DB utilising `https://github.com/typicode/json-server`

Other dependencies include:
Axios(GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE),
React-router-dom(for simple about and home page routing)
React-icons(for the delete button)

### Version 1.0.0

If connected to a back-end API, adding/deleting tasks and reminder sets are happening simultaniously both on the server and on the UI.
It is possible to use all features of the Task Tracker without a database, however upon reloading the page all changes made by the user will revert to default (no tasks to show).
